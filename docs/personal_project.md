# Personal Project Instructions

A few notes about this project before we get started:

- **It's OK to mess up.** That's what this one is for. Fight the good fight and try to do things right - even if it means your project isn't as presentable.
- **Schedule, schedule, schedule.** The most important thing here is to have a schedule and try to stick to it. Even if you don't, your schedule will keep you honest.
- **Got problems? Communicate!** This should go without saying, but keep your mentor aware of what you're doing and why - even if things aren't going according to plan.

## Week 1: Plan.

For this first personal project, we're going to clone an existing full-stack web application. Why? Well, it's easier for us to think about the technology when we aren't worrying about the concept, and it's easy to learn and implement CSS when we have a clear design we're going for.

You have **four choices** for a clone:

- **Tumblr**
- **Reddit**
- **Pinterest**
- **Evernote**

Choose one, come up with a clever name (ex: "Evernote" becomes "Clevernote"), and create a repo with a README. based on the Project Ideation lecture notes, create wireframes, a database structure, and example state, and an example routing/component structure.

Then, outline a plan with a timeframe to accomplish all of these things. Utilize the [lecture notes](https://github.com/joinpursuit/Pursuit-Core-Web/blob/master/react_2/project_ideation/project_ideation.md) as your instructions. Create a [Trello board](https://trello.com/) with each feature in your timeframe. Create three columns: "Not Started", "In Progress/Reviewed", and "Finished". This is how you'll keep track of your progress.

You will have a mentor - an instructor or a TA - who will be assigned to review your proposal and check in with you for the remainder of the project.

## Weeks 2-4: Implement.

According to your project plan, implement the clone. Make sure you try to keep up with the timeframe that you set out! Make sure you keep your Trello board updated!

Each week, you'll have at least one scheduled meeting with your mentor. Make sure to utilize this opportunity to keep your mentor updated and share any issues or opportunities you might have found.

## End of Week 4: Demo.

At the end of Week 4, we'll be having each student demonstrate their progress on their project. Don't worry if it's not perfect- this is a great opportunity to celebrate how far you've come and prepare for discussing this project in a professional setting.
